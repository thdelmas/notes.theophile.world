  - Platform-independent
  - Works across various operating systems
  - More versatile for different server types

### Server-Side Setup

1. **Enable Remote Access:**
   - **Windows:** Enable Remote Desktop in System Properties.
   - **Linux:** Install and configure a VNC server (e.g., TightVNC, RealVNC).

2. **IP Address Configuration:**
   - Ensure a static IP address or use dynamic DNS.
   - Forward ports:
     - **RDP:** 3389
     - **VNC:** 5900

3. **Security:**
   - Set a strong password for remote access.

### Tablet-Side Setup

1. **Download Client App:**
   - **RDP:** Microsoft Remote Desktop or RD Client.
   - **VNC:** VNC Viewer, bVNC, or RealVNC.

2. **Configure Connection:**
   - Enter server IP or hostname.
   - Specify port number if changed.
   - Input username and password.

## Integrating Bluetooth Peripherals

### Choosing Compatible Devices

- Ensure Bluetooth keyboard and mouse are:
  - Compatible with Android.

## Optimizing Your Remote Access Setup

### VNC for Versatility

1. Install a VNC server on the remote machine.
2. Configure for remote connections.
3. Use a VNC client app on the Samsung tablet.

### RDP Alternative

- Use third-party RDP clients for local device redirection.
- Connect to console session using `mstsc /admin` on Windows 7 or later.

## Enhancing Mobility and Productivity

- **Portable Stand:** Lightweight, adjustable stand for the tablet.
- **Power Bank:** High-capacity power bank for extended sessions.
- **Travel Case:** Padded case for equipment protection.

## Establishing the Connection

2. Open RDP/VNC client app on the tablet.
3. Select server connection and enter credentials.

## Troubleshooting and Optimization

- **Input Lag:** 
  - Update OS and Bluetooth drivers.
  - Reduce distance between devices.
  - Use Bluetooth 5.0 or later.

- **Resolution Mismatch:** 
  - Adjust server display settings for VNC.

- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Use wired connection for the server.
  - Adjust display settings in the client.

## Security Considerations
