# Installing Linux and KDE Plasma for Enhanced Mobile Functionality

## Why?

If you're stuck with an outdated version of Android, such as Android 6.0, while newer versions like Android 14 are available, you might find it challenging to download and use the latest apps from the Play Store. This can severely limit your device's functionality. By installing Linux and KDE Plasma on your mobile device, you can bypass these limitations and unlock a broader range of applications and features.

## How?

### Step 1: Install Linux

1. **Backup Your Data**: Before starting, ensure all your important data is backed up.
2. **Choose a Linux Distribution**: Select a lightweight Linux distribution compatible with mobile devices, such as Ubuntu Touch or PostmarketOS.
3. **Download the Installer**: Visit the official website of your chosen Linux distribution and download the installer.
4. **Prepare a Bootable USB Drive**: Use a tool like `Rufus` (for Windows) or `Etcher` (for macOS and Linux) to create a bootable USB drive with the Linux installer.
5. **Enable Developer Mode**: On your mobile device, go to Settings > About Phone and tap on the Build Number seven times to enable Developer Mode.
6. **Unlock Bootloader**: Follow the specific instructions for your device to unlock the bootloader.
7. **Flash the Linux OS**: Connect your mobile device to your computer, boot into fastboot mode, and use the terminal or command prompt to flash the Linux OS onto your device.

### Step 2: Install KDE Plasma

1. **Update Package Lists**: Once Linux is installed, open the terminal and update your package lists:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```
2. **Install KDE Plasma**: Install KDE Plasma by running the following command:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install kde-plasma-desktop
    ```
3. **Set KDE Plasma as Default**: Configure KDE Plasma to be your default desktop environment. This can typically be done through your display manager settings.
4. **Reboot Your Device**: Restart your mobile device to apply the changes.
