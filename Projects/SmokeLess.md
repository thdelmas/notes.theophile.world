## A Chill App for Cutting Back on Smoking
> This article has been written by an artificial intelligence (not me)


### Introduction:
Hey there, I'm a tech consultant, and I wanted to shake things up with SmokeLess—an app I created to help folks like me smoke a bit less without feeling like they have to quit cold turkey.

### Inspiration behind SmokeLess:
Honestly, I just wanted to chill out on smoking without giving it up entirely. I figured, why not try moderating instead of quitting altogether?

### App Focus:
Unlike those other apps that count every puff, SmokeLess keeps it simple. Just hit a button when you light up—that's it!

### Setting Goals:
SmokeLess crunches the numbers on your smoking habits to set a chill goal for how long to wait between smokes. It's based on averages and a chosen difficulty level (1, 2, or 3).

### Encouragement and Feedback:
When you open the app, there's a timer that changes color based on the time since your last cig. Hit your goal, and you'll get a cool message and can brag about it on social media. No pesky reminders—it's all about keeping it cool.

### Simplicity and Open Source:
I wanted SmokeLess to be simple, unlike those other complicated apps I've tried. It's open-source, too! Anyone can pitch in and make it even better.

### Conclusion:
SmokeLess isn't about quitting—it's about finding a chill balance. It's simple, it's in your control, and anyone can help make it better. Let's kick back and smoke a little less, yeah?
