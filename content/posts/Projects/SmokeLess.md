## Smoke Less: A Chill App for Cutting Back on Smoking

### Why?

Smoking is a habit many find difficult to quit, but not everyone wants to stop cold turkey. Smoke Less was created to offer a more relaxed approach to reducing smoking, allowing users to moderate their habits without the pressure of quitting entirely.

### How?

#### App Focus:
Smoke Less is designed to be straightforward and user-friendly. Unlike other apps that track every cigarette, Smoke Less keeps things simple—just tap a button when you light up.

#### Setting Goals:
The app analyzes your smoking patterns and sets a goal for how long you should wait between cigarettes. You can choose from three difficulty levels (1, 2, or 3) to match your desired pace of reduction.

#### Encouragement and Feedback:
When you open the app, a timer displays the time elapsed since your last cigarette. The timer's color changes to indicate your progress. If you meet your goal, you'll receive a positive message and have the option to share your achievement on social media. There are no intrusive reminders—it's all about maintaining a relaxed approach.

#### Simplicity and Open Source:
Smoke Less is intentionally kept simple to avoid overwhelming users. Additionally, it's open-source, inviting contributions from anyone interested in improving the app.

### What?

#### Outcomes and Benefits:
- **Moderation Over Quitting:** Smoke Less helps you reduce smoking gradually, making it easier to manage and stick to.
- **User-Friendly:** The app's simplicity ensures it's easy to use without adding stress.
- **Positive Reinforcement:** Encouraging messages and the option to share achievements help keep you motivated.
