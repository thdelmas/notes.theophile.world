## Mixing Emojis and Music for Magic Playlists

I've always been a bit terrible at naming my music playlists. I mean, how do you encapsulate a vibe or a feeling in just a few words, right? So, I set out on this wild idea that merges my love for freedom, art, and innovation with the crazy emotional rollercoaster that is music.

My tech background led me to help startups spread their wings, and I also dabbled as the tech and teaching honcho at the 42 Network campus in Barcelona. But hey, let's talk about something really cool I've been tinkering with—a little something called Smojify.

Picture this: music and emotions, they're like this magic combo, you know? You could listen to the same song in different moods and feel like it's a whole new track. That got me thinking—what if we used emojis to capture those feelings? I started creating playlists for each emoji out there.

So, here's what Smojify is about. It's this app on your phone that buddies up with Spotify. While you're vibing to your tunes, you can hop onto Smojify and react with emojis, just like you'd do on social media. The twist? These reactions help create playlists based on those emojis, adding new tracks at the top while shuffling the rest.

Now, I'm no mind reader when it comes to feelings. That's why I've got two playlist levels: one for you, where only your reactions count, and another for the world—a global playlist that mixes everyone's vibes. After all, not everyone feels the same way about a song, right?

The best part? Smojify doesn't tell you what emojis or feelings you're having. Nope, you're the boss. Your emojis, your playlists, your unique vibe.

Even though Smojify hasn't hit the big leagues officially, folks who've given it a whirl or heard about it? They're loving it! That's pretty exciting to hear, to be honest.

I dream big for Smojify. It'd be super cool if Spotify hopped on board and integrated it directly. Imagine that! And hey, if we gather enough data, maybe we could connect music with emotions on a global scale. Now, that's a wild ride I'd love to take.

Oh, and by the way, the code and APK for Smojify? They're out there on GitHub, just waiting for curious minds, music buffs, and potential collaborators to dive in and add their own magic.

So, that's Smojify—a little experiment that blends music, emojis, and emotions. Who knows where this journey will take us, but I'm excited to find out.

Catch you on the flip side as Smojify keeps dancing to the beat of emojis and emotions.
