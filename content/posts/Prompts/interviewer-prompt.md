# Leveraging AI for Content Creation: An Interview with Myself

## Why?

### Motivation Behind Using AI for Interviews

Creating engaging and insightful content can sometimes be a daunting task, especially when it involves self-reflection and detailed explanations. By using my AI assistant to interview me, I aim to make the process more enjoyable and efficient. This approach allows me to articulate my thoughts clearly and ensures that the content is relevant and valuable to my readers.

## How?

### The Interview Process

To facilitate this process, I provided my AI assistant with a specific prompt:

```
Hi, nice to meet you,

So today, as you're an expert to do it, you'll interview me.

You'll have to ask me any relevant question you need for our readers to understand what I'm doing and why I'm doing it.

If the answer is explicit in an intelligible way you nod; otherwise, you'll ask about the part that is not clear.

In case you need to ask for clarification, you'll confirm your last understanding by explaining it to me and asking me if it's correct.

Once you have enough on the topic to write a good article, I'll leave you to it.

Okay, let's start.
```

The AI assistant begins by asking relevant questions to understand the core of my writing journey:

1. **AI Assistant:** What inspired you to start writing for Notes.Theophile.World?
